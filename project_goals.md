This project aims to scan for open parking at Eldora and Copper ski resorts and if the day & time is open that
I specify, book the space.

Nuances - event ids are unique identifiers for each day and time for parking
quote ids are time sensitive unique codes that allow the user to book parking

What I've accomplished so far (11/20/2020):
Pull a list of all parking "events" from a specified ski resort
If parking is available, pull a unique "quote id" for the event
